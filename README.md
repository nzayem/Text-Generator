# Text-Generator

The title says it all, a very simple text generator based on a corpus from The entire script of Game Of Thrones.

The code generates sentences of desired length based on TriGrams. Each sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation sign.

Very basic algorithm, used NLTK to just generate the trigrams just as an introduction to NLTK.

Here are some of the generated sentences:

``"Here we are. Billy climbs a tree to piss on us. F**k off!" ðŸ™€``

``"Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores..." ðŸ˜‚``

``"I'm wildly expensive. Take off your clothes. Oh. Come in, my queen." ðŸ™ˆ``
